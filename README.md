# Team Plus

![Cover Image](/public/cover.webp)

Team Plus is your personal project management tool for efficient team collaboration.

It really is just using react for a few of my user interfaces.

## 🏎️ Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
- Start the development server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BayBreezy/team-plus.git
cd team-plus
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🐳 Docker

You can just run the production build with the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Take a look at the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for more details.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Vitest is used for testing, and you can find the test files in the `tests` directory.
